            <h2><b>River</b></h2>

            <p>River, (ultimately from Latin ripa, “bank”), any natural stream
                of water that flows in a channel with defined banks . Modern
                usage includes rivers that are multichanneled, intermittent, or
                ephemeral in flow and channels that are practically bankless.
                The concept of channeled surface flow, however, remains central
                to the definition. The word stream (derived ultimately from the
                Indo-European root srou-) emphasizes the fact of flow; as a
                noun, it is synonymous with river and is often preferred in
                technical writing. Small natural watercourses are sometimes
                called rivulets, but a variety of names—including branch, brook,
                burn, and creek—are more common, occurring regionally to
                nationally in place-names. Arroyo and (dry) wash connote
                ephemeral streams or their resultant channels. Tiny streams or
                channels are referred to as rills or runnels.

                Rio Grande
                Rio Grande
                The Rio Grande flowing through the desert at the foot of the
                Chisos Mountains in Big Bend National Park, Texas.
                Rivers are nourished by precipitation, by direct overland
                runoff, through springs and seepages, or from meltwater at the
                edges of snowfields and glaciers. The contribution of direct
                precipitation on the water surface is usually minute, except
                where much of a catchment area is occupied by lakes. River water
                losses result from seepage and percolation into shallow or deep
                aquifers (permeable rock layers that readily transmit water) and
                particularly from evaporation. The difference between the water
                input and loss sustains surface discharge or streamflow. The
                amount of water in river systems at any time is but a tiny
                fraction of the Earth’s total water; 97 percent of all water is
                contained in the oceans and about three-quarters of fresh water
                is stored as land ice; nearly all the remainder occurs as
                groundwater. Lakes hold less than 0.5 percent of all fresh
                water, soil moisture accounts for about 0.05 percent, and water
                in river channels for roughly half as much, 0.025 percent, which
                represents only about one four-thousandth of the Earth’s total
                fresh water.

        <div id="Importance"> <h2><b>Importance of rivers</b></h2>
            <p>The inner valleys of some great alluvial rivers contain the sites
                of ancestral permanent settlements, including pioneer cities.
                Sedentary settlement in Hither Asia began about 10,000 years ago
                at the site of Arīḥā (ancient Jericho). Similar settlement in
                the Tigris-Euphrates and Nile valleys dates back to at least
                6000 BP (years before present). The first settlers are thought
                to have practiced a hunting economy, supplemented by harvesting
                of wild grain. Conversion to the management of domesticated
                animals and the cultivation of food crops provided the surpluses
                that made possible the rise of towns, with parts of their
                populations freed from direct dependence on food getting.
                Civilization in the Indus River valley, prominently represented
                at Mohenjo-daro, dates from about 4500 BP, while civilization in
                the Ganges valley can be traced to approximately 3000 BP.
                Permanent settlement in the valley of the Huang He has a history
                some 4,000 years long, and the first large irrigation system in
                the Yangtze catchment dates to roughly the same time. Greek
                invaders of the Syr Darya, Amu Darya, and other valleys draining
                to the Aral Sea, east of the Caspian, encountered irrigating
                communities that had developed from about 2300 BP onward.
            </p>

            <p>
                The influence of climatic shifts on these prehistoric
                communities has yet to be worked out satisfactorily. In wide
                areas, these shifts included episodic desiccation from 12,000 or
                10,000 BP onward. In what are now desert environments, increased
                dependence on the rivers may have proved as much a matter of
                necessity as of choice. All of the rivers in question have broad
                floodplains subject to annual inundation by rivers carrying
                heavy sediment loads. Prehistoric works of flood defense and
                irrigation demanded firm community structures and required the
                development of engineering practice. Highly elaborate irrigation
                works are known from Mohenjo-daro; the ziggurats (temple mounds)
                of the Euphrates valley may well have originated in ancient
                Egypt in response to the complete annual inundation of the Nile
                floodplain, where holdings had to be redefined after each flood
                subsided. It is not surprising that the communities named have
                been styled hydraulic civilizations. Yet, it would be simplistic
                to claim that riparian sites held the monopoly of the
                developments described. Elaborate urban systems arising in
                Mexico, Peru, and the eastern Mediterranean from about 4000 BP
                onward were not immediately dependent on the resources of
                rivers.

                Where riverine cities did develop, they commanded ready means of
                communication; the two lands of Upper and Lower Egypt, for
                instance, were unified by the Nile. At the same time, it can be
                argued that early riverine and river-dependent civilizations
                bore the seeds of their own destruction, independent of major
                climatic variations and natural evolutionary changes in the
                river systems. High-consuming cities downstream inevitably
                exploited the upstream catchments, especially for timber.
                Deforestation there may possibly have led to ruinous silting in
                downstream reaches, although the contribution of this process to
                the eventual decline of civilization on the Euphrates and the
                Indus remains largely a matter of guesswork. An alternative or
                conjoint possibility is that continued irrigation promoted
                progressive salinization of the soils of irrigated lands,
                eventually preventing effective cropping. Salinization is known
                to have damaged the irrigated lands of Ur, progressively from
                about 4400 to 4000 BP, and may have ruined the Sumerian empire
                of the time. The relative importance of environmental and social
                deterioration in prehistoric hydraulic civilizations, however,
                remains a matter of debate. Furthermore, defective design and
                maintenance of irrigation works promote the spread of malarial
                mosquitoes, which certainly afflicted the prehistoric hydraulic
                communities of the lower Tigris-Euphrates valley. These same
                communities also may have been affected by bilharziasis, or
                schistosomiasis (blood fluke disease), which requires a species
                of freshwater snail for propagation and which even today follows
                many extensions of irrigation into arid lands.</p>

        <div id="World’s largest rivers">
            <h2><b>World’s largest rivers</b></h2>
            <p>Area-length-discharge combinations vary considerably, although
                length tends to increase with area. On all counts except length,
                the Amazon is the world’s principal river. The Congo and the
                Paraná are among the largest by area and discharge, but the
                Mississippi, fourth in length and fifth in area, is only seventh
                in discharge. The Ganges-Brahmaputra, third in discharge, is
                13th (or lower) in area and well down the list of length for its
                two main stems taken separately.

                World average external runoff is about 0.01 cubic metre per
                second per square kilometre (0.6 cubic foot per second per
                square mile). Great rivers with notably higher discharges are
                fed either by the convectional rains of equatorial regions or by
                monsoonal rains that are usually increased by altitudinal
                effects. The Huang He averages 0.046 cubic metre per second per
                square kilometre, the Irrawaddy 0.032 cubic metre per second per
                square kilometre, the Magdalena and the Amazon 0.026 cubic metre
                per second per square kilometre, the Orinoco 0.021 cubic metre
                per second per square kilometre, and the Ganges-Brahmaputra
                above 0.024 cubic metre per second per square kilometre. Very
                high mean discharges per unit area are also recorded for lesser
                basins in mountainous coastlands exposed to the zonal westerlies
                of midlatitudes. Among great rivers with mean discharges near or
                not far below world averages per unit area are those of Siberia,
                the Mackenzie, and the Yukon (828,000 square kilometres, 5,900
                cubic metres per second), all affected by low precipitation for
                which low evaporation rates barely compensate. The basins of the
                Mississippi, Niger, and Zambezi include some areas of dry
                climate. The Nelson illustrates the extreme effects of low
                precipitation in a cool climate, while the Nile, Murray-Darling,
                and Shaṭṭ Al-ʿArab (Tigris-Euphrates) experience low
                precipitation combined with high evaporation losses.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Variation of stream regime">
            <h2><b>Variation of stream regime</b></h2>
            <p>Seasonal variation in discharge defines river regime. Three broad
                classes of regime can be distinguished for perennial streams. In
                the megathermal class, related to hot equatorial and tropical
                climates, two main variants occur; discharge is powerfully
                sustained throughout the year, usually with a double maximum
                (two peak values), but in some areas with a strong single
                maximum. In the mesothermal class some regimes resemble those of
                tropical and equatorial areas, with single or double summer
                maxima corresponding to heavy seasonal rainfall, while others
                include sustained flow with slight warm-season minima. Where
                midlatitude climates include dry summers, streamflow decreases
                markedly and may cease altogether in the warm half of the year.
                In areas affected by release of meltwater, winter minima and
                spring maxima of discharge are characteristic. Microthermal
                regimes, which are influenced by snow cover, include winter
                minima and summer maxima resulting from snowmelt and
                convectional rain; alternatively, spring meltwater maxima are
                accompanied by secondary fall maxima that are associated with
                late-season thunder rain, or spring snowmelt maxima can be
                followed by a summer glacier-melt maximum, as on the Amu Darya.
                Megathermal regimes, which are controlled by systematic
                fluctuations in seasonal rain, and microthermal regimes, which
                are controlled by seasonal release of meltwater, may be more
                reliable than mesothermal regimes.

                The regime can vary considerably along the length of a single
                river in timing and in seasonal characteristics. Spring maxima
                in the Volga headwaters are not followed by peak flows in the
                delta until two months later. The October seasonal peak on the
                upper Niger becomes a December peak on the middle river; the
                swing from tropical-rainy through steppe climate reduces volume
                by 25 percent through a 483-kilometre stretch. The seasonal
                headwater flood wave travels at 0.09 metre per second, taking
                some four months over 2,011 kilometres, but earlier seasonal
                peaks are reestablished on the lower river by tributaries fed by
                hot-season rains. The great Siberian rivers, flowing northward
                into regions of increasingly deferred thaw, habitually cause
                extensive flooding in their lower reaches, which remain
                ice-covered when upstream reaches have already thawed and are
                receiving the meltwaters of late spring and summer.

                Extremes of regime characteristics come into question when
                streams are classified as perennial, intermittent, or ephemeral.
                These terms are in common use but lack rigid definition. Whereas
                the middle and lower reaches of streams in humid regions rarely
                or never cease flowing and can properly be called perennial,
                almost every year many of their upstream feeders run dry where
                they are not fed by springs. In basins cut in impermeable
                bedrock, prolonged droughts can halt flow in most channel
                reaches. Karst (limestone country) that has some surface
                drainage often includes streams that are spatially intermittent;
                frequently it also contains temporally intermittent streams that
                flow only when heavy rain raises the groundwater table and
                reactivates outlets above the usual level. Temporally
                intermittent streams also occur in dry areas where, at low
                stage, only some channel reaches contain flowing water.</p>

        <h2><b>Determining factors</b></h2>
        <p>The asteroids and comets are remnants of the planet-building process
            in the inner and outer solar system, respectively. The asteroid belt
            is home to rocky bodies ranging in size from the largest known
            asteroid, Ceres (also classified by the IAU as a dwarf planet), with
            a diameter of roughly 940 km (585 miles), to microscopic dust
            particles that are dispersed throughout the belt. Some asteroids
            travel in paths that cross the orbit of Earth, providing
            opportunities for collisions with the planet. The rare collisions of
            relatively large objects (those with diameters greater than about 1
            km [0.6 mile]) with Earth can be devastating, as in the case of the
            asteroid impact that is thought to have been responsible for the
            massive extinction of species at the end of the Cretaceous Period 65
            million years ago (see dinosaur: Extinction; Earth impact hazard).
            More commonly, the impacting objects are much smaller, reaching
            Earth’s surface as meteorites. Asteroid observations from Earth,
            which have been confirmed by spacecraft flybys, indicate that some
            asteroids are mainly metal (principally iron), others are stony, and
            still others are rich in organic compounds, resembling the
            carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The asteroids that have been
            visited by spacecraft are irregularly shaped objects pockmarked with
            craters; some of them have retained very primitive material from the
            early days of the solar system.
